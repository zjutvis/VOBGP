## Abstract

The Border Gateway Protocol plays a significant role as the de-facto inter-domain routing protocol in the Internet, managing connectivity and coordinating routing decisions among autonomous systems. However, the absence of inherent security validation mechanisms exposes the inter-domain routing to various security risks, such as prefix hijacking, path forgery and route leakage. These vulnerabilities have significant implications for the stability and accessibility of the Internetâ€™s foundational infrastructure. This article presents a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art research in visualization and visual analytics for inter-domain routing security. Drawing from various security threats, we have identified four task scenarios for visual analysis: network monitoring, feature mining, anomaly detection, and pattern evolution. We further examine the research work in each category in terms of data types and visualization techniques. Our survey aims to offer researchers and practitioners systematic guidelines that can assist them in finding effective solutions for their research problems within specific application domains. Finally, we examine the trends of academic interest observed in recent decades and propose potential directions for future research in visual analytics pertaining to Internet infrastructure security.
